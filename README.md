a simple javaprogram to replace classes in all sqm, sqf, sqs, ext files in the folder and subfolders of the toollocation. Set classnames in the mdhClassReplace.cfg file

how does it work:
1. create and write log messages into the mdhClassReplaceLog.txt
2. read the mdhClassReplace.cfg to get the old and new classnames for the replacement
3. check every sqm, sqf, sqs, ext file in the folder and subfolders of the toollocation for the old classnames and replace them with the new one
